**naggati** - protocol builder for Mina

*Naggati* is Inuktitut for "make fit". This library allows you to write
mina `ProtocolDecoder` objects to decode incoming byte streams by describing
the protocol in a mini-DSL which generates a state machine. The protocol
decoder can be written in a threaded, sequential way, even though mina will
be invoking it asynchronously.

An example decoder for [ASN.1 tags](net/lag/naggati/asn1/Tag.scala.html) is
included.

The Primary class is [Decoder](net/lag/naggati/Decoder.html) which accepts
a starting [Step](net/lag/naggati/Step.html). The helper object
[Steps](net/lag/naggati/Steps$object.html) contains methods for creating
steps. Typically they describe waiting for some complete event (a line
terminated by a linefeed, or maybe just four bytes) and then code to process
that data, which also returns the next step.

The special step [End](net/lag/naggati/End$object.html) indicates that a
complete object has been read, and processing should start over again at the
first step. The [ProtocolError](net/lag/naggati/ProtocolError.html) exception
can be used to indicate errors.

[IoHandlerActorAdapter](net/lag/naggati/IoHandlerActorAdapter.html) is a
convenience class that converts mina events into actor messages, and creates
a new actor for each new mina `IoSession`.
